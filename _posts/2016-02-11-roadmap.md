title: Three Laws Blog - Roadmap

# Roadmap
The first purpose of this blog is to educate attorneys and law makers about AI, so that is the first thing that I will try to accomplish.

I am going to try to cover the following topics  early, since they are the most important things you need to know and understand going forward.

* Definitions of key terms and concepts
* What is AI and what is it not?
* What do we think AI can do?
* What dangers exist with AI?
* How does an AI get created and who is creating it?
* How soon do with think we will get to Human level? Beyond human level?
	
I'll continue to cover some of the more basic concepts and also explain new developments in the field. Once I get the basics above covered, I want to start the legal discussion right away. I am going to cover topics like;

* Why should we regulate AI?
* How can we regulate AI?
* what should be regulated?

	
After I accomplish those goals, I'll keep writing on new topics and news as the field develops.
