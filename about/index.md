## My Personal Interest:

In late summer of 2015 I stumbled across an article that has been in the back of my mind ever since, and has sent me deep down the rabbit hole into a new field of study. I have always been a bit of a nerd and I constantly keep up with the latest developments in the tech industry. However, I was blown away about where we currently are with  Artificial Intelligence (AI), where we are going, and what may actually be possible within my lifetime. AI already here in a more limited form, but what most people think of as science fiction AI is coming and it will drastically impact our future. The article that I read (which is in two parts) is <i>The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence</i> by Tim Urban of the website Wait But Why.[^1]. I encourage you to read both parts of the article and then to think about what you read for a few days, or if you are like me, try to stop thinking about it. 

After reading this article, I've experienced the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon and it seems like every day there is something new and groundbreaking occuring in AI. Whether or not  AI will be the cure to all of humanities problems or AI will end us all, or whether we will achieve human level intelligence in 10 years or 50 years, nobody knows. However, it cannot be denied that we are making huge strides in AI and more discoveries and breakthroughs are going to start happening much more quickly. 

AI is already a large industry. In 2016, At the start of 2016, there are an estimated 900 companies working in AI and last year Venture Capitalist groups alone invested $2,100,000,000 (<a>http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/25/investing-in-artificial-intelligence/</a>).  Major corporations are spending more and more money on AI research and development and AI seems ripe to create a situation where Doctor Ian Malcolm might say, "Scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should." Unlike the scientists of Jurassic Park, many of techs top minds welcome regulation *************

I am an attorney and I have spent a lot of time the last few months looking into what sort of regulations exist regarding AI research and development and found very little on point. There isn't even much of a discussion going on in our field about AI and what should be done, if anything about it. I am not a scientist and I have yet to form an opinion on whether I think AI will be beneficial or not to society. I don't even know whether AI will get close to that point within my lifetime. However, I am fascinated by the possibilities, both good and bad, and my fascination has led me to create this blog.

As I stated, there is not much information available in the legal field from the perspective of how the law should be involved with AI. There have been numerous calls from tech industry leaders stating that AI should be a regulated field (elon, altman, woz),  but there has been little discussion from within the legal community. There is a future law review article from the Harvard Law Journal on the subject and some commentary on that article. While these pieces show that there are some out there thinking about these topics, I wanted to create a forum that explains what is happening in the AI field in plain english for attorneys and government officials so that they might understand why tech industry leaders and others have called for government regulation, and  to provide legal analysis, discussion, and suggestions aimed at other attorneys and the legislature to get the discussion moving.
