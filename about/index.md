 The purpose of this blog is to
	1. Educate attorneys and law makers about the emerging field of Artificial Intelligence, and 
	2. Create a discussion within the legal field about what can/should be done in regards to regulating Artificial Intelligence research and development

##My Personal Interest:
In the late summer of 2015 I stumbled across and article on a website that has consumed most of my thoughts and has sent me deep down the rabbit whole into a new field. Artificial Intelligence (AI).  I have always been a bit of a nerd and fascinated with technology, so I consider myself well informed with what goes on in the tech industry. I was blown away about where we are with AI, where we are going, and what is theoretically possible within my lifetime. AI is here and it is changing our world now and it will drastically impact our future. The article that I read (which is really two parts) is "The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence" by Tim Urban of the website Wait But Why (http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html). I encourage you to read both parts of the article and then to think about what you read for a few days, or if you are like me, try to stop thinking about it. 

Whether or not  AI will be the cure to all of humanities problems or AI will end us all, or whether we will achieve human level intelligence in 10 years or 50 years, it cannot be denied that we are making huge strides in AI and discoveries and breakthroughs are only going to come more and more quickly. AI is quickly becoming big business [insert industry quotes] and major corporations are spending more and more money on AI research and development. AI seems poised to become a situation where a future Doctor Ian Malcolm might say, "Scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should." 

I am an attorney and I have spent a lot of time looking into what sort of regulations exist regarding AI research and development and found nothing. There isn't even much of a discussion going on in our field about AI and what should be done, if anything about it. I am not a scientist and I have yet to form an opinion on whether I think AI will be beneficial or not to society and I don't know whether AI will get to that point within my lifetime. However, I am fascinated by the possibilities, both good and bad, which have inspired this blog.

As I stated, there is not much information available in the legal field from the perspective of how the law should be involved with AI. There have been numerous calls from tech industry leaders stating that AI should be a regulated field (elon, altman, woz)  but from within the legal community, there has not been much movement and there has been no movement, to my knowledge, from the legislature. There is a future law review article from the Harvard Law Journal on the subject and some commentary on that article. While these pieces so that there are some out there thinking about these topics, I wanted to create a forum that explains what is happening in the AI field in plain english for attorneys and government officials so that they might understand why tech industry leaders and others have called for government regulation, and  to provide legal analysis, discussion, and suggestions aimed at other attorneys and the legislature to get the discussion moving.


In 2016, At the start of 2016, there are an estimated 900 companies working in AI and last year Venture Capitalist groups alone invested $2,100,000,000 (http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/25/investing-in-artificial-intelligence/). We all know that the law is very slow to catchup to technology and this is one field that will not wait for us to get caught up to speed.
